# Renart - Renaissance Art Classifier

Renart is a sophisticated machine learning model designed to authenticate and analyze Renaissance artwork. By analyzing image characteristics, it can identify artists, authenticate pieces, and provide detailed analysis of artistic elements such as brush strokes, creation period, and distinctive features. This tool aims to assist galleries, museums, and art experts in verifying artwork authenticity and discovering forgeries.

## 🎨 Features

- **Artist Identification**: Accurately identifies the artist based on their unique style and techniques
- **Artwork Authentication**: Helps detect potential forgeries by analyzing artistic elements
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides comprehensive information about:
  - Brush stroke patterns
  - Creation period estimation
  - Material composition
  - Artistic techniques used
  - Historical context
- **High-Resolution Image Processing**: Supports detailed examination of high-resolution artwork images
- **Multi-Period Recognition**: Covers various Renaissance periods and artistic schools
